# 1808-B-BCP Prep Repository

## Getting Started

1. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - I suggest installing 'ESLint', as I've included a linting setup in this repo.
2. [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - Node is slightly different between windows and mac.
3. Familiarize yourself with basic terminal commands. On Windows, we're talking about `Powershell` and on Mac we're talking about `terminal`. There are upgrades to both.
  - Windows has a very cool one called [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
  - On Mac most people like [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
  - Learn your basic commands in the terminal! You will be using these all the time in the future. [Commands on Mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line). [Commands on Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-command-prompt-commands-4092302).
4. Practice using these commands to navigate your filesystem!
5. Make a folder for all your VSCode for this class. Open that folder in VSCode. File -> Open -> Select Folder. You will see the all the files in that folder if you use the explorer (top button on the left in VSCode).
6. Open the Integrated Terminal through -> View -> Integrated Terminal
7. Type the following in that terminal and hit enter (in succession): `npm install -g yarn` then, `yarn`
8. Go to 'Extensions' in VSCode (the bottom button on the far left hand side of the window. It looks like a box.) and search for 'ESLint' and install it.
8. In the terminal run `npm install -g nodemon@latest`
9. Navigate to your VSCode folder. Use `ls` or `dir` to ensure you see all the files here. **REMEMBER TO BE SAVING FILES WITH `.JS` AT THE END.** In your terminal of choice, run  `nodemon -q ${location of your file}`. You will see the terminal display either nothing - or whatever `console.log`'s exist within your file. Every time you save - it will reprint results to the- terminal!

You can make a Github account and use it to go to the issues tab on this page and file `issues` with the README or any part of this setup/codebase that isn't working for you!
